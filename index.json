False sharing and fragmentation are two showing problems that degrade the performance of concurrent memory allocators. Allocator may actively or passively cause false sharing by splitting a cache line to different processes in turn or by reusing the free pieces. On the other hand, internal and external fragmentation may cause unbounded memory blowup. Hoard assigns a local heap for each processor and maintains a global heap. All the memory in heaps is managed in a structure called superblock with the same size and exploits the locality by using LIFO free list. In the runtime, all the per-processor heaps would keep the emptiness under a given threshold. The freest superblock would be delivered to the global heap if the emptiness is too high. When calling malloc, the space of the lease free superblock would be used. Overall, with bounded memory overhead, Hoard make a concurrent allocator fast and salable.\nStrengths  As fast as a uniprocessor allocator; The memory consumption is theoretically and experimentally bounded; Largely alleviate the false sharing problem.  Weaknesses  Lock overhead and global heap contention; The false sharing problem has not been totally removed; Deliver the large objects management to virtual memory system.  How to improve  Design a lock-free heap framework that further reduce the overhead of synchronization, especially for single-thread cases; Internal fragmentation for smalle objects could be further reduced by a cleaning daemon.

This problem becomes severe when applying it to the encryption of network data flows. A standard solution to leasing such laborious work is to use the digest of flows which contains several or hundreds of packets in a row. However, the intrinsics of best-effort delivery in current Internet make this solution impractical. It is even more challenging to get almost in-order and entire sequences of packets of a multicast flow. If we lost some of the packets in a flow, the decryption or verification would be blocked by them, and these packets may never be able to receive in multicast flows.\nChung et al. proposed two chaining techniques as opposed to the current sign-each approach. The general purpose of these two approaches is to make packets in a flow verifiable individually. The first one is called star-chaining: each packet holds its position in the flow, the digest of the rest of the packets in the block it belongs to, and the digest of the digests of all packets in the block. For the first packet, the receiver could verify it by recomputing the combination of the digest of the payload and the digests of the others and compare it to the block digest. After the first verification, the verifier only needs to compare if its digest of the payload is the same as the first packet. They improved this method to so-called tree-chaining by using less space (log of block size) within a packet but not increasing the computation load a lot (in case that computation speed scale linearly with the packet length) because what the overhead for a packet is decreased to the sibling and parents of itself in the tree built from the block.\nBased on tree chaining with degree-two (binary), they further perfected the performance of signature operations by extending the FFS signature scheme on several aspects:\n They used the first satisfiable prime numbers to reduce the verification time and critical size. They employed the Chinese Remainder Theorem to simplify it more. What is more, the authors pointed out the duplicate part of the computation, so they just precomputed those in advance and stored it for future use. They provided adjustable and incremental verification that allows a more flexible tradeoff between security level and computation time.  In general, this paper provided many good insights that deserve attention. However, there are still some spaces to improve since their assumption may not apply to all possible situations (e.g., high-speed networking). By removing some redundancy and build more paradigms, the verification pair could speed up more in the future.\nReference [1] Wong, C. K., \u0026amp; Lam, S. S. (1998, October).

However, the authors of Crail (Stuedi, P. et al., 2017) point out that most of the recent applications are too low-brewed and too focused on serving particular workloads to satisfy general task requirement.\nCrail is a user-level I/O architecture for Spark, an Apache data processing systems, fully utilising the high-performance networking and storage hardware from scratch. Usually, the bottom of a stack is where hardware integrations happen. This problem is also known as Deep Layering, one of the software-related I/O bottlenecks (Animesh Trivedi et al., 2016). In addition, Data Locality and Legacy Interfaces contribute to the difficulties of leveraging high-performance hardware in Spark and its analogs. The authors state that Crail has solved the problems listed above by using storage tiering and resource disaggregation over a high-performance RDMA network.\nThe targeting I/O operations that Crail focuses on is the temporary data, which was generated from data shuffling, broadcasting within jobs or shared across jobs. In fact, two of the most frequently used workloads supported by Spark would gain remarkable efficiency improvement by adopting the Crail architecture.\nThe authors establish that the actual overheads in Spark network operations are caused mainly by the software stack rather than networking hardware. They make a consequent conclusion, proved by their solid experiments, that overheads of running these engines could be reduced by the disaggregated environment. This finding further supports the research on flash storage disaggregation (Klimovic, A. et al., 2016), making lots of relevant thoughts explorable.\nReference [1] Stuedi, P., Trivedi, A., Pfefferle, J., Stoica, R., Metzler, B., Ioannou, N., \u0026amp; Koltsidas, I.

In 15th {USENIX} Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation ({NSDI} 18). USENIX} Association.\nLeast hit density (LHD) [1] is a brand-new cache replacement algorithm designed for key-value caches. An improvement to the cache hit rate of current distributed, in-memory key-value caches has shown more and more importance in demand of latency sensitive applications recently. However, some most popular used policies like least recently used (LRU) or first in first out (FIFO) have their own problems. For instance, The performance of LRU would be largely lowered down if cache pollution happens. Other complicated policies that introduce parameter tuning may cause unreliable performance and some mechanisms employ synchronized states which could increase the cost and decrease the throughput.\nHowever, the strategy for specific workload can be somehow improved. Beckmann, N., Chen, H., \u0026amp; Cidon, A. propose the LHD which would predict the expected hit-per-space (hit density) that is consumed by each object. The main idea of LHD is to monitor the probability of an object that would hit the cache during the lifetime and divide it by the resources it would consume. The basic evicting step, just like most of the algorithms in this area, is replacing the cache block that has the lowest hit density. In other words, the insight is to make small objects that hit frequently. The hit probability can be calculated by this simple formula: collected hits / (size * lifetime). What’s more, LHD would absorb the extra information about objects intuitively.\nIn order to prove the effectiveness of this algorithm, they implement a specific Memcached-based application named RankCache which includes the LHD ranking function. Besides hit density, RankCache can also support other arbitrary ranking functions. For management of memory, RankCache chooses to use slab allocation in order to make the performance of insertion and eviction is predictable. As a approximate scheme, RankCache has a high tolerance to loosely synchronized events and the aging information collecting from Memcached, and its allocator was succeeded to enforce delicate synchronizations.\nAccording to the data shown by the authors of LHD, RankCache would have much higher throughput than its competitors under specific hit ratio. After introducing information on tags, RankCache performs better. However, the eviction performance is not good in terms of SET operations. This performance gap may be somehow alleviated by the performance gain from the GET operations, which are much more time-consuming in most of the key-value cache systems.\nReference [1] Beckmann, N., Chen, H., \u0026amp; Cidon, A.

The authors point out that remote access to hard disks and remote access to Flash using RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) are two common ways to offer flexibility and efficiency in a data center. However, they prove these existing approaches are facing two critical problems: the first is how to tradeoff between performance and cost, while the second is how to provide predictable performance without interferences. Thus they design this system to avoid the problems current systems may raise while still meeting the performance expectations.\nReFlex uses a tightly integrated data plane architecture to provide low latency and high throughput access to remote Flash. In the first place, the authors exploit the virtualization features in the hardware, though it is a software system, to transfer data and requests without copying them. Also, the polling-based execution model eliminates the interruptions of process. Thanks to the novel QoS scheduler, ReFlex serves different types of tenants to enforce SLOs (Service-Level Objectives), even for different data streams. By these means, the authors state that ReFlex is able to deal with thousands of tenants and network connections due to its high utilization to CPU cores.\nThe architecture of ReFlex is Client-Server model: server is responsible for executing the models mentioned above and clients are written for applications to access the servers. Moreover, the authors re-design the control plane that runs on every ReFlex server to balance the loads. ReFlex outreaches its competitors on tail latency, request/response throughput and CPU resources utilization, with well-behaved QoS scheduling and tenant isolations.
