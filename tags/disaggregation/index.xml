      <description>The performance of networking and storage hardware has developed rapidly in recent years. Emerging new interfaces like RDMA and NVMe make user-level hardware access and asynchronous I/O possible, allowing upper applications to take full advantages of these high-performance hardware. However, the authors of Crail (Stuedi, P. et al., 2017) point out that most of the recent applications are too low-brewed and too focused on serving particular workloads to satisfy general task requirement.</description>

      <title>ReFlex Review - ASPLOS &#39;17 </title>

      <description>The Paper[1] presents a remote-flash-accessing system called ReFlex, which provides comparable performance to accessing local Flash. The authors point out that remote access to hard disks and remote access to Flash using RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) are two common ways to offer flexibility and efficiency in a data center. However, they prove these existing approaches are facing two critical problems: the first is how to tradeoff between performance and cost, while the second is how to provide predictable performance without interferences.</description>
