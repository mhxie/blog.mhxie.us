      <description>Summary This paper presents a multi-kernel OS called Barrelfish for multicore hardware. The authors argued that current OS design and hardware-specific optimization could not exploit heteronomous cores nor suit the diverse, interconnected topology, and messages cost less than shared memory with the development of distributed or event-driven systems.
They designed the architecture of Barrelfish structured like a distributed system. It enforced explicit inter-core communication patterns to exploit the high-level knowledge to achieve more efficient cache-line updates.</description>

      <title>Mach Review</title>

      <description>Summary Mach is a new kernel design based on UNIX that supports multi-processors by using inter-process communications (IPC). Mach presents several new primitive abstractions including task, thread, port, and message. Task could be a multi-threaded execution environments that contains all the resources including the virtual memory spaces and protected access to ports, while threads are the smallest computation. What&amp;rsquo;s more, Mach manages virtual memory with copy-on-write and read/write sharing ability. It splits the machine-dependent and independent sections by using data structures like address maps, share maps, VM objects and page structures.</description>

      <title>Hoard Review - ASPLOS IX</title>
      <link>https://blog.mhxie.us/review/hoard_asplosix/</link>

      <description>Summary Hoard is a concurrent memory allocator algorithm that achieves both a performance close to the uniprocessor allocator and a low memory fragmentation rate. False sharing and fragmentation are two showing problems that degrade the performance of concurrent memory allocators. Allocator may actively or passively cause false sharing by splitting a cache line to different processes in turn or by reusing the free pieces. On the other hand, internal and external fragmentation may cause unbounded memory blowup.</description>
